    <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
            <p>
                Some potentional customers may view membership costs as expensive compared to local fitness alternatives.
                Memebership agreements can sometimes have long-term commitments, which may deter potential members. Franchise
                locations may vary in terms of equipment quality and customer service, affecting brand consistency. Popular 
                locations can experience overcrowding, leading to negative workout experience during peak hours.

    <h3>Opportunities</h3>
            <p>
                There is potential for Gold's Gym to enter emerging markets and undeserved locations, increasing membership base.
                Developing an online platform for virtual classes and training programs can attract a broader audience, especially 
                post-pandemic. Collaborating with health and wellness brands can enhance offerings and attract new members. Capitalizing
                on the growing trend of holistic health and wellness can lead to the introduction of new programs, such as nutrition 
                coaching and mental health support.

            <h3>Threats</h3>
            <p>
                The fitness industry is highly competitive, with many gyms, boutique studios, and home workout solutions vying for 
                market share. Economic challenges can lead to reduced discretionary spendning, affecting gym memberships and retention
                rates. A shift toward home workouts and virtual training options may impact tradtional gym attendance. Ongoing health 
                regulations and potential lockdowns can disrrupt operations and limit member engagemnent.
